OpenICE-lite is our team's effort to simplify the predecessor implementation, named as OpenICE, toward the goal of plug-and-play medical device interoperability. Incorporating MQTT middleware, OpenICE-lite features light-weight, modularized architecture to provide a framework for the integration of medical devices and applications into closed-loop monitoring or Medical Internet of Things.
